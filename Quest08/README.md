**Description**

Write a function named hidenp that takes two strings and returns 1
if the first string is hidden in the second one,
otherwise returns 0 followed by a newline.

Let s1 and s2 be strings. We say that s1 is hidden in s2 if it's possible to
find each character from s1 in s2, in the same order as they appear in s1.
Also, the empty string is hidden in any string.

**Function prototype (c)**
```
int hidenp(char* param_1, char* param_2)
{

}

```
**Example 00**
```
Input: "fgex.;" && "tyf34gdgf;'ektufjhgdgex.;.;rtjynur6"
Output: 
Return Value: 1
```

**Example 01**
```
Input: "abc" && "btarc"
Output: 
Return Value: 0
```

**Example 02**
```
Input: "" && "long string ?ddl"
Output: 
Return Value: 1
```

**Description**

Were going to dive into what lies behind the text to columnability used in Excel. For example, say you have a list of 100 names of people who have registered for an event formatted as John Doe but you need to separate first name and last name into their respective columns so that you have John and Doe.

Create a function that splits a string of characters depending on a separator. (sounds crazy....keep reading!)

The second argument is a unique character separator.

The function should return an array which contains a string wrapped between separator.

There cannot be any empty strings in your array.

The string given as an argument of the function won't be modifiable.

**Function prototype (c)**
```
string_array* my_split(char* param_1, char* param_2)
{

}
```
**Example 00**
```
Input: "abc def gh-!" && "-"
Output: 
Return Value: ["abc def gh", "!"]
```
**Example 01**
```
Input: "abc def gh-!" && " "
Output: 
Return Value: ["abc", "def", "gh-!"]
```
**Example 02**
```
Input: "abc def gh!" && "d"
Output: 
Return Value: ["abc ", "ef gh!"]
```
**Example 03**
```
Input: "" && ""
Output: 
Return Value: []
```

**Description**

Write a function that takes a string, and returns another string which contains exactly one
space between words, with no spaces or tabs either at the beginning or the end.

A "word" is defined as a part of a string delimited either by spaces/tabs, or
by the start/end of the string.

**Example 00:**
```
Input: "See? It's easy to print the same thing"
Output: "See? It's easy to print the same thing"
```
**Example 01:**
```
Input: " this        time it      will     be    more complex  . "
Output: "this time it will be more complex ."
```
**Example 02:**
```
Input "No  S***    Sherlock..."
Output: "No S*** Sherlock..."
```
**Example 03:**
```
Input ""
Output: ""
```
**Function prototype (c)**
```
char* my_strip(char* param_1)
{

}
```
